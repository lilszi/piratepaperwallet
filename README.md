# piratepaperwallet
piratepaperwallet is a Pirate Sapling paper wallet generator that can run completely offline. You can run it on an air-gapped computer to generate your shielded z-addresses, which will allow you to keep your keys completely offline. 

# Download
piratepaperwallet is available as pre-built binaries from our [release page(Linux,Mac)](https://github.com/mrmlynch/piratepaperwallet/releases), or [release page(Windows)](https://github.com/lilszi/piratepaperwallet/releases). Download the zip file for your platform, extract it and run the `./piratepaperwallet` binary. 

# Generating wallets
To generate a pirate paper wallet, simply run `./piratepaperwallet`

You'll be asked to type some random characters that will add entropy to the random number generator. Run with `--help` to see all options

## Saving as PDFs
To generate a pirate paper wallet and save it as a PDF, run
`./piratepaperwallet -z 3 --format pdf piratepaper-output.pdf`

This will generate 3 shielded z-addresses and their corresponding private keys, and save them in a PDF file called `piratepaper-output.pdf`

# Compiling from Source

## Run without network
If you are running a newish version of Linux, you can be doubly sure that the process is not contacting the network by running piratepaperwallet without the network namespace.

`unshare -n` runs the process without a network interface which means you can be sure that your data is not being sent across the network.
